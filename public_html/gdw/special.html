<h1>Special Characters</h1>

Since &lt; > have special meaning in HTML, you can't use
these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use
the so called "special characters" to represent them. For example,
to have less than sign appear in your document, you need to use
&lt; to represent it.&amp;
