<h1>Inline Elements</h1>

<p><a>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a
paragraph or division.
Each element does different things to the text. <b>This text is in a strong
element. This text is in a bold (b) element.</b>Bold and strong seem to have
the same effect. This is <i>emphasised (em) text.</i> It seems to look the
same as this <i>italicized text here.</i></a></p>

<p><a>Putting text inside quote elements, "like this quoted text here," makes
the text display with quotation marks around it. Code (code) tags are meant
for source code examples. They look like <code>code text here.</code> The
keyboard element (kbd) looks the same, <kbd>keyboard text here</kbd>, but is
meant for examples of user entered data.<a></p>

<a>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say. <sup>this is
superscript</sup> and <sub>this is subscript.</sub>
