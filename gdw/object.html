<a>by Lil Skies</a>

<br>One time just a little bit, I</br>
One time just a little bit, I (go 'head, O)</br>
One time just a little bit, I</br>
I (Danny, I see you)</br>
<p> </p>
I, I, I, I don't wanna get close</br>
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe</br>
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro</br>
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't</br>
I get high, I love to smoke</br>
She gon' lie like I'm a joke</br>
You wanna take flights across the coast</br>
Remember those times, no horoscope</br>
<p> </p>
Life goes on, I can't take breaks</br>
I need face, no, I need faith</br>
In my mind, I can't escape</br>
I climb these heights like I'm an ape</br>
Shine so bright in a world so dark</br>
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart</br>
Two door coupe, just push to start</br>
Climb right in, let me break your heart</br>
<p> </p>
I don't need no one</br>
I don't need no one</br>
I don't need no one</br>
Still never sober</br>
Still never sober</br>
Got the world on my shoulders</br>
Comin' out bolder</br>
Yeah, I'm comin' out bolder</br>
I ride with my soldiers</br>
Ride for my soldiers</br>
Thought that I told you</br>
I thought that I told you</br>
<p> </p>
I, I, I don't wanna get close</br>
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe</br
Haven't been the same since I lost my bro</br>
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't</br>
I get high, I love to smoke</br>
She gon' lie like I'm a joke</br>
You wanna take flights across the coast</br
Remember those times, no horoscope</br>
I, I, I don't wanna get close</br>
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe</br>
Haven't been the same since I lost my bro</br>
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't</br>
I get high, I love to smoke</br>
She gon' lie like I'm a joke</br>
You wanna take flights across the coast</br>
Remember those times, no horoscope, I</br>
<p> </p>
I don't want the fame</br>
I don't wanna play these games</br>
Tired of hiding from the pain</br>
Never hanging with the lames, I</br>
I'm not the one for the stupid shit (yeah)</br>
We shot a scene on some movie shit (whoa)</br>
And she came right through on some groupie shit (whoa)</br>
Be surprised how they act when they know you lit</br>
<p> </p>
I don't wanna get close</br>
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe</br>
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro</br>
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't</br>
I get high, I love to smoke</br>
She gon' lie like I'm a joke</br>
You wanna take flights across the coast</br>
Remember those times no horoscope</br>
I, I, I don't wanna get close</br>
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe</br>
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro</br>
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't</br>
I get high, nigga, yes I smoke</br>
She gon' lie like I'm a joke></br>
You wanna take flights across the coast</br>
Remember those times no horoscope, I</br>
